#🖼️ CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow (Keras API).

The model is trained to recognize 10 different object categories from 32×32 RGB images.
📊 Expected Performance

With 5 epochs, the model typically achieves:

✅ ~65% – 75% Test Accuracy

(Accuracy may vary depending on runtime environment.)
